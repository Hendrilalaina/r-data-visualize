<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<ul>
<li>Objectives: leaflet, geospatial</li>
<li>Requirements: R Data-Mining</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1854 a Cholera epidemic haunts London. By then common theory is
that Cholera is transmitted by air. English physician John Snow doubts
this theory and is maybe the first one to perform geospatial analysis.
He plot locations of Cholera-deaths and pumps and finds the causal link
between water and Cholera. We will take a loook at his results and learn
how to use <strong>leaflet</strong> package.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-import" class="section level1" number="2">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Data Import</h1>
<p>You need to download data of <strong>Cholera Pumps &amp;
Deaths</strong> from the link in Bibliography at the end of this article
and save .csv file locally.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>deaths_pumps &lt;- read.csv(&quot;../RUltimateMaterial-main/data/Cholera Pumps &amp; Deaths.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="data-preparation" class="section level1" number="3">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Data preparation</h1>
<p>We need two packages: * <em>leaflet</em> for geospatial plotting *
<em>dplyr</em> for data preparation</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(leaflet)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Attaching package: &#39;leaflet&#39;</code></pre>

##     addLegend</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)</code></pre>
<p><em>geometry</em> variable in <em>deaths_pumps</em> requires an
extraction of longitude and latitude coordinates. Some irrelevant
information is removed with <em>gsub</em>. Then, longitude and latitude
information is extracted with <em>strsplit</em>, <em>unlist</em> and
<em>as.numeric</em>. Coordinates (long and lat) are stored in one long
vector <em>coords</em>. But they are easy to split: longitudes are small
(below zero) and latitude above 50. Then, dataframe
<em>deaths_pumps</em> is separated into <em>deaths</em> and
<em>pumps</em>. Deaths are indicated by a count above 0 and pumps by a
count below 0.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Create Geospatial
Plot</h1>
<p>We create an object <strong>lf</strong> which will include all our
information on the plot. First, we apply function
<strong>leaflet</strong> and make extensive use of pipping operator to
load further information. We use Stamen.Toner to get the more classical
black and white look. With <strong>setView</strong> we define the center
and zoom of our map. We add circles for deaths and pumps.</p>
<p>Deaths are marked in red. With increasing death count radius
increases. Pumps are marked in green.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>With this visualization Snow was able to detect certain hotspots. In
Broadwick Street (then: Broad Street) there is a pump and many
Cholera-realated deaths, while in other regions there are pumps and no
deaths at all. Based on this he was able to refuse theory of air-borne
Cholera transfer. He put his theory to test by disabling pump in Broad
Street and saved many lifes.</p>
<p>We learned how easy it is to reproduce his results with
<strong>leaflet</strong>.</p>
